# steps:

for environment, bulid up step by step:

- [x] step 1: have 2d box environment of grid (import from dict), with agent being able to be at any point and move around
- [x] step 2: have the agent train on PPO to hit some target
- [x] step 3: implement randomized environments and walls -- REVISIT
- [x] step 4: implement physics, agent velocity, etc.
- [x] step 5: implement display
- [ ] step 6: implement A\* pathfinding
